            <div class="spiel_title_left">What is My-Ai <em>Life</em>?</div>

            <p>My-Ai <em>Life</em> is a virtual world that offers a whole new level of interaction with your Ais.</p>

            <p>Focusing on customization, community and creativity, My-Ai <em>Life</em> will offer numerous ways for
                your Ais to grow, creating ever-more stories to fuel their burgeoning lives.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="spiel">
            <img src="<spring:url value='/static/images/life-style.png'/>" class="spiel_image_right"/>

            <div class="spiel_title_right">Style</div>

            <p>Your Ai has character, now give them some style to back it up.</p>

            <p>Utilize the My-Ai character designer to pick a look for your character, right down to their sex and body
                type. The style you come up with will become your Ais avatar in the world of My-Ai <em>Life</em>.</p>

            <p>Layerable clothing and accessory options, color-customization and player-created content means that the
                possibilities for customization are practically endless.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="spiel">
            <img src="<spring:url value='/static/images/life-shop.png'/>" class="spiel_image_left"/>

            <div class="spiel_title_left">Shop</div>

            <p>Unsatisfied with the default options? No problem. Visit the market and grab some new designs.</p>

            <p>The market is the place to grab new items and outfits for your Ais. An ever-expanding selection
                is available thanks to both internal updates as well as player created content. Nothing take your fancy?
                Create or commission your own design and sell it on the market to other players.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="spiel">

            <div class="spiel_title_right">Advance</div>

            <p>Slacker? Student? Senator? What would your Ai like to achieve in their virtual life?</p>

            <p>Pick a career for your Ais and help them climb the corporate ladder. Part narrative and part functional
                a career can provide a story, an income for use on the market or possibly assist their beloved creator
                in his or her own endeavors.</p>

        <div class="spiel">

            <div class="spiel_title_left">Develop</div>

            <p>Push it to the limit!</p>

            <p>Skills are an important part of life, they let us achieve all sorts of things from the mundane to the
                fantastic. Develop your Ais skills to help them in their careers and open up new opportunities.</p>

            <p>You can even work with other Ais to teach them your skills, or learn from their experience.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="spiel">
            <img src="<spring:url value='/static/images/life-connect.png'/>" class="spiel_image_right"/>

            <div class="spiel_title_right">Connect</div>

            <p>Meet new friends... or enemies if you like.</p>

            <p>Ais will bump into each other from time to time, maybe they'll work at the same place, live on the same
                street, or are stalking the same celebrity... (it happens). Random events in the game will lead to new
                interactions, introductions and eventually relationships.</p>

            <div class="spiel_title_left">Create</div>

            <p>We don't call you creators for nothing.</p>

            <p>Creating doesn't stop with just your Ais. You can create all sorts of custom content for My-Ai
                <em>Life</em>, from new outfits to sell on the market, to buttons and badges for player's pages to
                housing and furniture.</p>

            <p>If you can draw, then you can create content for My-Ai <em>Life</em></p>
